## Overview {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note}
#### Notes for Development:
- Include more weeks to get the final project done
- Undergrads: installed + 3/4 commit messages
:::

The graduate-level final project (ATOC 5815) requires you to **independently develop a Python package** for atmospheric or oceanic data analysis while **contributing to at least one classmate's project**. This mirrors real-world research software development where you maintain your own code while contributing to colleagues' projects.

::: {.callout-important}
#### Project Details
- **Weight**: 25% of final grade
- **Timeline**: Weeks 12-15
- **Team Size**: Individual (with peer collaboration)
:::

**Deliverables**:

- Your own installable Python package (pip or conda)
- GitHub repository with proper workflow
- Minimum 5 commits on your project
- Minimum 1 Pull Request to another student's project
- Documentation and example usage

# Learning Objectives

# Collaborative Workflow

## Finding Projects to Contribute To

**Week 14**: Instructor will share spreadsheet with all projects:

| Student Name | GitHub Repo | Project Description | Needs Help With |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Alice | github.../qc-tools | Weather QC | Visualization |
| Bob | github.../wind-rose | Wind analysis | More statistics |
| Charlie | github.../profiles | Ocean profiles | NetCDF support |

## Making a Contribution

**Step 1: Contact the project owner**

```
"Hi Alice! I'm interested in contributing to your weather QC project.
I see you're looking for visualization help. I was thinking of adding
a function to plot QC results over time. Would that be useful?"
```

**Step 2: Fork and clone**

```bash
# Fork their repo on GitHub, then:
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/their-package.git
cd their-package

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream git@github.com:original-owner/their-package.git
```

**Step 3: Create feature branch**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-qc-visualization
```

**Step 4: Implement your contribution**

- Write code following their style
- Add docstrings
- Test your changes
- Update documentation

**Step 5: Submit Pull Request**

```bash
git add your_changes.py
git commit -m "Add QC visualization function"
git push origin feature/add-qc-visualization
```

Then open PR on GitHub with description:

```markdown
## Description
Adds visualization function for QC results over time.

## Changes
- Add `plot_qc_timeseries()` function
- Uses matplotlib for plotting
- Highlights flagged values in red
- Includes example in docstring

## Testing
Tested with sample weather station data.
Creates clear, informative plots.

## Questions
- Should this go in `viz.py` or `utils.py`?
- Any preference on color scheme?
```

**Step 6: Respond to feedback**

- Address comments
- Make requested changes
- Push updates (PR auto-updates)

## Receiving Contributions

**When someone opens a PR to your project:**

1. **Review promptly** (within 2-3 days)
2. **Test their code** locally:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout origin/their-feature-branch
   # Test their changes
   ```
3. **Provide feedback**:
   - What works well
   - What needs improvement
   - Questions or suggestions
4. **Approve or request changes**
5. **Merge when ready**

# Tips for Success

## For Your Own Package

- **Start simple**: Get basic functionality working first
- **Test as you go**: Don't wait until end to test installation
- **Document continuously**: Write docstrings as you code
- **Commit often**: Small, frequent commits
- **Keep it focused**: Better to do a few things well

## For Contributing to Others

- **Communicate first**: Ask before starting big changes
- **Follow their style**: Match existing code style
- **Test thoroughly**: Your code should work
- **Be patient**: They may be busy, give them time to review
- **Be receptive**: Accept feedback graciously

## Time Management

- **Week 14**: Focus 80% on your project, 20% on finding contribution
- **Week 15**: Finish your project first, then make contribution
- **Don't wait until last day**: For your contribution (need time for review)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Starting contribution too late (no time for review)
- Not testing installation until the end
- Unclear package scope (too ambitious)
- Ignoring PR feedback
- Trivial contributions (fixing typos doesn't count)

# Summary: What Makes This Different

## From Undergraduate Project (4815)

- You create a reusable package (not just analysis)
- You contribute to someone else's code (collaboration)
- You use professional GitHub workflow (industry practice)
- You conduct code reviews (professional skill)

## Why This Structure

- Each student owns their project (better for CV/portfolio)
- Learn to contribute to others' code (real open-source practice)
- More realistic for research (everyone has their own code but contributes to lab projects)
- Broader exposure (see multiple projects, not just your own)
- Networking (interact with all classmates' work)
- No partnership drama (work independently but collaborate)

## Real-World Parallel

This mirrors actual research software development:

- Maintain your own tools/packages
- Contribute bug fixes/features to colleagues' code
- Review others' contributions to your code
- Part of a collaborative research group

::: {.callout-tip}
## Final Note
This project will give you a portfolio piece and real-world collaboration experience!
