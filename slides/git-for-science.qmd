# Introduction {background-color="#2F2F2F"}

## Why Version Control? {.smaller}

**Real scenario from atmospheric science research:**

::: {.incremental}
- You write code to analyze climate model output
- It works! You submit your paper
- Reviewer asks: "What if you change the threshold?"
- You modify the code
- **Everything breaks**
- You can't remember what the working version looked like
- Panic sets in...

- Original: [jackatkinson.net/slides/git_for_science.html](https://jackatkinson.net/slides/git_for_science.html)
- Adapted for atmospheric science workflows
- Examples tailored to climate/weather analysis

**Thank you, Jack, for the great template!**

# Why Git Matters for Science {background-color="#9CA898"}

## Research Software is Critical {.smaller}

**Your code influences important decisions:**

::: {.incremental}
- **Weather forecasts** - Emergency management relies on model output
- **Climate projections** - Policy decisions worth trillions of dollars
- **Air quality** - Public health warnings
- **Aviation** - Flight safety and routing
- **Agriculture** - Crop predictions and water management
:::

::: {.fragment}
**If your code has bugs, people could make wrong decisions**

→ Quality matters!
:::

## What is Git? {.smaller}

**Git is not just a series of backups**

It's a **project management system** that tracks:

::: {.incremental}
- **What** changed (every line of code)
- **When** it changed (timestamp)
- **Who** changed it (author)
- **Why** it changed (commit message)
- **How** to undo it (full history)
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Think of it as "Track Changes" for code, but way more powerful**
:::

## Git vs Dropbox/OneDrive {.smaller .scrollable}

| Feature | Git | Dropbox/OneDrive |
|---------|-----|------------------|
| Track who changed what | ✅ Yes, line-by-line | ❌ No |
| Meaningful change messages | ✅ Yes, commit messages | ❌ No |
| Work on multiple features simultaneously | ✅ Yes, branches | ❌ No |
| Merge conflicting changes | ✅ Yes, smart merge | ⚠️ Creates duplicates |
| Collaborate with strangers | ✅ Yes, pull requests | ❌ Hard |
| Review before accepting changes | ✅ Yes, code review | ❌ No |
| Undo specific changes | ✅ Yes, revert commits | ⚠️ Version history |

::: {.fragment}
**Bottom line:** Dropbox backs up files. Git manages projects.
:::

# Git Core Concepts {background-color="#2F2F2F"}

## Repositories {.smaller}

**A repository (repo) is a project folder tracked by Git**

```bash
my_analysis/
├── .git/              # Git's database (don't touch!)
├── analyze_temp.py    # Your code
├── plot_results.py
├── data/
│   └── temperatures.nc
└── README.md
```

::: {.fragment}
The `.git/` folder contains:

- All history
- All branches
- All commits
- Configuration
:::

::: {.fragment}
**You never edit .git/ directly - use git commands!**
:::

## Commits {.smaller}

**A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific time**

```{mermaid}
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': { 'git0': '#5DA9E9', 'gitBranchLabel0': '#ffffff', 'commitLabelColor': '#000000', 'commitLabelBackground': '#ffffff'}}}%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial analysis"
    commit id: "Add QC checks"
    commit id: "Fix temperature bug"
    commit id: "Add plotting"
```

::: {.fragment}
Each commit contains:

- **Complete snapshot** of all files
- **Commit message** (what changed and why)
- **Author** (who made the change)
- **Timestamp** (when it happened)
- **Parent commit** (what came before)
:::

## Diffs {.smaller}

**A diff shows exactly what changed between commits**

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Before:**
```python
def calculate_mean(temps):
    """Calculate mean temperature"""
    return sum(temps) / len(temps)
```
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**After:**
```python
def calculate_mean(temps):
    """Calculate mean temperature"""
    return np.mean(temps)  # Better!
```
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Git shows this as:**
```
- return sum(temps) / len(temps)    # Red (removed)
+ return np.mean(temps)              # Green (added)
```

Lines with `-` = removed (red in terminal)
Lines with `+` = added (green in terminal)
:::

## Branches {.smaller}

**Branches let you work on multiple things simultaneously**

```{mermaid}
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': { 'git0': '#5DA9E9', 'git1': '#66B266', 'git2': '#E8A838', 'gitBranchLabel0': '#ffffff', 'gitBranchLabel1': '#ffffff', 'gitBranchLabel2': '#ffffff', 'commitLabelColor': '#000000', 'commitLabelBackground': '#ffffff'}}}%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "Working analysis"
    commit id: "Paper submitted"
    branch bug-fix
    commit id: "Fix QC threshold"
    checkout main
    branch new-feature
    commit id: "Add spatial plots"
    commit id: "Add significance tests"
    checkout main
    merge bug-fix
    merge new-feature
```

::: {.fragment}
**Use cases:**
- `main` - stable, working code
- `bug-fix` - fix a specific bug
- `new-feature` - develop new functionality
- `reviewer-response` - address reviewer comments
:::

# Essential Git Commands {background-color="#9CA898"}

## Setup: Configure Git {.smaller}

**First time only - tell Git who you are:**

```bash
# Set your name (shows in commits)
git config --global user.name "Alice Johnson"

# Set your email (links to GitHub)
git config --global user.email "alice.johnson@colorado.edu"

# Set default editor (nano is easiest)
git config --global core.editor "nano"

# Check your settings
git config --list
```

::: {.fragment}
**This information appears in every commit you make**
:::

## Creating a Repository {.smaller}

**Option 1: Start from scratch (local)**

```bash
cd ~/ATOC4815/my_project
git init
# Creates .git/ folder - now tracked by Git!
```

**Option 2: Clone existing repository (from GitHub)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
cd repo
# Now you have a copy with full history
```

::: {.fragment}
**For this class: You'll mostly clone assignments from GitHub**
:::

## The Basic Workflow {.smaller}

**Every time you make changes:**

```bash
# 1. Check what changed
git status

# 2. See the actual changes
git diff

# 3. Stage files for commit (tell Git what to save)
git add analyze_temp.py
# or add everything:
git add .

# 4. Commit (save a snapshot)
git commit -m "Fix temperature calculation bug"

# 5. Push to GitHub (backup + share)
git push
```

## Git Status - Your Best Friend {.smaller}

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   analyze_temp.py

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	plot_results.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

::: {.fragment}
**Translation:**
- `analyze_temp.py` - modified, not staged
- `plot_results.py` - new file, not tracked
- **Action:** Run `git add` to stage them
:::

## Git Diff - See What Changed {.smaller}

```bash
$ git diff analyze_temp.py
```

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Before (old code):**
```python
def qc_temperature(temp):
    if temp < -50 or temp > 50:
        return None
    return temp
```
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**After (your changes):**
```python
def qc_temperature(temp):
    if temp < -90 or temp > 60:  # Updated!
        return None
    return temp
```
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Shows line-by-line changes before you commit**

In your terminal, removed lines appear in <span style="color: red;">**red**</span> and added lines in <span style="color: green;">**green**</span>
:::

## Committing Changes {.smaller}

**Good commit:**

```bash
git commit -m "Expand temperature QC range for polar data

The previous range (-50 to 50°C) was rejecting valid Antarctic
observations. Updated to -90 to 60°C based on WMO standards."
```

**Bad commit:**

```bash
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "asdf"
git commit -m "Update"
```

::: {.fragment}
**Good commit messages:**
- Start with verb (Fix, Add, Update, Remove)
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- First line is summary (< 50 chars)
- Blank line, then details if needed
:::

## Pushing to GitHub {.smaller}

**After committing, send changes to GitHub:**

```bash
git push
```

::: {.fragment}
**First time pushing a new branch:**

```bash
git push -u origin main
# -u sets up tracking, only needed once
```
:::

::: {.fragment}
**What push does:**
- Uploads your commits to GitHub
- Others can now see your changes
- Backs up your work
- Enables collaboration
:::

# Working with Branches {background-color="#2F2F2F"}

## Why Branches? {.smaller}

**Scenario: You're working on a paper**

::: {.incremental}
- Your code works, analysis complete
- Reviewer asks: "Try a different method"
- You start changing code
- Halfway through: "Oh no, the old method had a bug too!"
- Now you need to:
  - Fix the bug in the submitted version
  - Continue developing the new method
  - Keep them separate!
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Solution: Branches let you work on both simultaneously**
:::

## Branch Workflow {.smaller}

```{mermaid}
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': { 'git0': '#5DA9E9', 'git1': '#66B266', 'git2': '#E8A838', 'gitBranchLabel0': '#ffffff', 'gitBranchLabel1': '#ffffff', 'gitBranchLabel2': '#ffffff', 'commitLabelColor': '#000000', 'commitLabelBackground': '#ffffff'}}}%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial paper results"
    commit id: "Submitted to journal"
    branch reviewer-method
    checkout reviewer-method
    commit id: "Start alternative method"
    commit id: "Implement new approach"
    checkout main
    branch bug-fix
    commit id: "Fix original bug"
    checkout main
    merge bug-fix id: "Merge bug fix"
    checkout reviewer-method
    commit id: "Finish alternative method"
    checkout main
    merge reviewer-method id: "Merge for revision"
```

## Branch Commands {.smaller}

**Create and switch to new branch:**

```bash
# Create branch
git branch new-feature

# Switch to it
git checkout new-feature

# Or do both at once:
git checkout -b new-feature
```

**See all branches:**

```bash
git branch
  main
* new-feature    # * shows current branch
```

**Switch branches:**

```bash
git checkout main
```

## Merging Branches {.smaller}

**When feature is done, merge back to main:**

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Merge feature branch in
git merge new-feature

# If successful, delete feature branch
git branch -d new-feature
```

::: {.fragment}
**Merge conflicts happen when:**
- Same lines changed in both branches
- Git can't decide which to keep
- You manually resolve (we'll cover this later)
:::

# Repository Infrastructure {background-color="#9CA898"}

## Essential Files {.smaller}

**Every repository should have:**

::: {.incremental}
1. **README.md** - What is this project?
2. **LICENSE** - Can others use your code?
3. **.gitignore** - What files to NOT track?
:::

::: {.fragment}
**These files are the first thing people see on GitHub!**
:::

## README.md {.smaller}

**Your project's front page**

```markdown
# ATOC 4815 Temperature Analysis

Analysis scripts for Boulder temperature trends 1950-2025.

## Installation

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate temp-analysis
```

## Usage

```bash
python analyze_temps.py --input data/boulder.csv
```

## Data Sources

NOAA Boulder weather station (Station ID: GHCND:USC00050848)

## Contact

Alice Johnson (alice.johnson@colorado.edu)
```

## What Makes a Good README? {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
1. **Title** - What is this?
2. **Description** - What does it do? (1-2 sentences)
3. **Installation** - How to set it up?
4. **Usage** - How to run it? (examples!)
5. **Data** - Where does data come from?
6. **Contact** - Who to ask questions?
7. **Citation** - How to cite your work?
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Make it easy for your future self (6 months from now) to use this code**
:::

## LICENSE {.smaller}

**Do others have permission to use your code?**

::: {.tiny}
**For academic research, common choices:**

**MIT License** (most permissive):
- ✅ Anyone can use, modify, sell
- ✅ Just need to include license text
- Example: NumPy, Flask, Rails

**GPL License** (copyleft):
- ✅ Anyone can use, modify
- ⚠️ Must share modifications under GPL
- Example: Linux, Git itself

**CC BY 4.0** (for data/docs):
- ✅ Share, adapt, commercial use
- ⚠️ Must give credit
- Example: Papers, datasets, documentation

**GitHub has a license picker:**
- Go to repository → Add file → Create new file → "LICENSE"
- Choose from templates
:::

## .gitignore {.smaller}

**Tell Git to ignore certain files**

```bash
# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
.pytest_cache/

# Jupyter
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# Data (too large for Git)
data/*.nc
data/*.csv
*.h5

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*~
```

::: {.fragment}
**Why ignore files?**
- Too large (> 100 MB)
- Generated automatically
- Contain secrets/passwords
- User-specific (IDE configs)
:::

## What NOT to Commit {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**❌ DON'T commit:**

- Large data files (> 100 MB)
- Passwords or API keys
- Generated files (.pyc, .o)
- IDE config files
- Binary files (unless necessary)
- Your entire conda environment

**Use .gitignore for these!**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**✅ DO commit:**

- Source code (.py, .R, .jl)
- Documentation (.md, .txt)
- Configuration files (small!)
- Example data (< 1 MB)
- Environment spec (environment.yml)
- Scripts and notebooks

**These are what makes the project runnable!**
:::

# Collaborative Workflows {background-color="#2F2F2F"}

## GitHub != Git {.smaller}

**Git** = Version control system (runs locally)

**GitHub** = Website for hosting Git repositories

::: {.fragment}
**Alternatives to GitHub:**
- **GitLab** - Similar, some prefer it
- **Bitbucket** - Atlassian product
- **Gitea** - Self-hosted option
- **Your own server** - Just need SSH

**This class uses GitHub because it's most common in science**
:::

## Forking vs Cloning {.smaller}

**Cloning** = Make a local copy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/owner/repo.git
```

- You can pull updates
- Can't push unless you have permission

**Forking** = Make your own copy on GitHub

- Click "Fork" button on GitHub
- Now you have `github.com/YOUR_NAME/repo`
- You CAN push to your fork
- Can submit pull requests to original

::: {.fragment}
**Use case:** Contributing to someone else's project
:::

## Pull Requests {.smaller}

**A pull request (PR) is a request to merge your changes into someone else's repository**

::: {.incremental}
1. Fork their repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a branch for your changes
4. Make commits
5. Push to your fork
6. Open pull request on GitHub
7. Discuss/review
8. They merge it!
:::

::: {.fragment}
**PRs are how open-source development works**
:::

## Code Review {.smaller}

**Before merging, someone should review your code**

**What reviewers check:**

::: {.incremental}
- **Does it work?** Test the code
- **Is it clear?** Can you understand it?
- **Is it correct?** Are the calculations right?
- **Is it documented?** Docstrings, comments
- **Does it follow style?** PEP 8 for Python
- **Any bugs?** Edge cases, error handling
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Code review catches bugs before they reach production!**
:::

## Code Review Example {.smaller}

**Original code (from a real student submission):**

```python
def calc(x, y):
    z = []
    for i in range(len(x)):
        z.append(x[i] - y[i])
    return z
```

**Reviewer comments:**

::: {.tiny}
> What does this function do? Need a docstring.
>
> Function name "calc" is not descriptive
>
> This can be simplified with NumPy
:::

**After revision:**

```python
def calculate_temperature_dewpoint_difference(temp_c, dewpoint_c):
    """
    Calculate temperature minus dewpoint (T-Td)

    Args:
        temp_c: Array of temperatures in Celsius
        dewpoint_c: Array of dewpoints in Celsius
    Returns:
        Array of T-Td values
    """
    return temp_c - dewpoint_c
```

## How to Be a Good Code Reviewer {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
1. **Be specific** - Don't just say "fix this," explain what's wrong
2. **Be constructive** - Suggest improvements, don't just criticize
3. **Praise good code** - "Nice use of list comprehension!"
4. **Ask questions** - "Why did you choose this approach?"
5. **Focus on learning** - It's a teaching opportunity
6. **Be kind** - Remember there's a person on the other side
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Bad review:** "This code is terrible"

**Good review:** "This function is hard to understand. Could you add a docstring explaining what it does? Also, lines 15-20 could be simplified with NumPy's `np.where()` function."
:::

# Common Git Scenarios {background-color="#9CA898"}

## Scenario 1: Undo Last Commit {.smaller}

**"I just committed but forgot to add a file!"**

```bash
# Add the forgotten file
git add forgotten_file.py

# Amend the last commit (replaces it)
git commit --amend --no-edit

# If you want to change the message too:
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
```

::: {.fragment}
**⚠️ Only amend commits that haven't been pushed!**
:::

## Scenario 2: Discard Local Changes {.smaller}

**"I broke everything, just go back to last commit"**

```bash
# See what changed
git status

# Discard changes to one file
git checkout -- analyze_temp.py

# Or discard ALL changes
git reset --hard HEAD
```

::: {.fragment}
**⚠️ This DELETES your changes! Can't undo this!**
:::

## Scenario 3: Merge Conflict {.smaller}

**"Git says there's a conflict - help!"**

```bash
$ git merge feature-branch
Auto-merging analyze_temp.py
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in analyze_temp.py
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

**Git marks conflicts in the file:**

```python
<<<<<<< HEAD
temp_threshold = 50  # Current branch
=======
temp_threshold = 60  # Feature branch
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

**Fix it:**

1. Choose which version to keep (or combine)
2. Delete the markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
3. `git add analyze_temp.py`
4. `git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"`

## Scenario 4: Sync with Upstream {.smaller}

**"My fork is out of date with the original repo"**

```bash
# Add original repo as "upstream" (once)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repo.git

# Fetch updates from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream's main into your main
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Push to your fork
git push origin main
```

::: {.fragment}
**Do this regularly to avoid huge merge conflicts later!**
:::

## Scenario 5: Accidentally Committed to Main {.smaller}

**"I meant to create a branch but committed to main!"**

```bash
# Create branch from current state
git branch my-feature

# Reset main to before your commits
git reset --hard origin/main

# Switch to your feature branch
git checkout my-feature

# Your commits are now on the feature branch!
```

::: {.fragment}
**Works because commits are still saved, just moved**
:::

# Git Best Practices {background-color="#2F2F2F"}

## The Golden Rules {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
1. **Commit often** - Small commits > huge commits
2. **Write good messages** - Future you will thank present you
3. **Use branches** - Don't do everything on main
4. **Pull before push** - Sync with team first
5. **Review your own code** - Check `git diff` before committing
6. **Don't commit secrets** - API keys, passwords stay out!
7. **Test before pushing** - Make sure it works
:::

## Commit Message Tips {.smaller}

**Good commit messages follow a pattern:**

```bash
# Format:
<type>: <short summary>

<longer description if needed>

# Types:
feat: Add new temperature plotting function
fix: Correct timezone handling in data loader
docs: Update README with installation instructions
style: Format code with black
refactor: Simplify QC logic without changing behavior
test: Add tests for temperature calculations
chore: Update dependencies in environment.yml
```

::: {.fragment}
**Why this matters:** GitHub, GitLab, and many tools parse these!
:::

## Branching Strategy {.smaller}

**For research projects:**

```{mermaid}
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': { 'git0': '#5DA9E9', 'git1': '#66B266', 'git2': '#E8A838', 'git3': '#D47FA6', 'gitBranchLabel0': '#ffffff', 'gitBranchLabel1': '#ffffff', 'gitBranchLabel2': '#ffffff', 'gitBranchLabel3': '#ffffff', 'commitLabelColor': '#000000', 'commitLabelBackground': '#ffffff'}}}%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial code"
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit id: "Work in progress"
    branch feature/new-plot
    checkout feature/new-plot
    commit id: "Add spatial plot"
    checkout develop
    merge feature/new-plot
    branch bug/fix-qc
    checkout bug/fix-qc
    commit id: "Fix QC threshold"
    checkout develop
    merge bug/fix-qc
    checkout main
    merge develop id: "Release for paper"
```

- `main` - stable, matches published paper
- `develop` - active work
- `feature/*` - new features
- `bug/*` - bug fixes

## When to Commit {.smaller}

**✅ Good times to commit:**

::: {.incremental}
- Feature works (even if not complete)
- Fixed a specific bug
- Added a complete function
- Updated documentation
- End of work session
:::

**❌ Don't commit:**

::: {.incremental}
- Code doesn't run
- Halfway through a change
- Without testing it first
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Rule of thumb:** Each commit should be a logical unit of work

## Git GUIs vs Command Line {.smaller}

**GUI (Graphical User Interface):**

::: {.tiny}
**Pros:**
- Visual representation of branches
- Easier to see diffs
- Point and click commits
- Less scary for beginners

**Cons:**
- Different tools work differently
- Some operations still need command line
- Hides what's actually happening
:::

**Command Line:**

::: {.tiny}
**Pros:**
- Works everywhere (even on servers)
- All features available
- Understand what Git is doing
- Faster once you learn it

**Cons:**
- Steeper learning curve
- Easy to make mistakes
- Have to memorize commands
:::

::: {.fragment}
**My recommendation:** Learn command line basics, use GUI for visualization

# Practice Time! {background-color="#2F2F2F"}

## Hands-On Exercise {.smaller}

**Let's practice the workflow:**

::: {.incremental}
1. Fork this repository: [github.com/WillyChap/git-practice](https://github.com/WillyChap/git-practice)
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a branch called `add-your-name`
4. Edit `students.md` - add your name
5. Commit with message "Add [Your Name] to students list"
6. Push to your fork
7. Open a pull request to the original repo
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Let's do this together!**
:::

## Common Mistakes (and How to Fix Them) {.smaller}

::: {.tiny}
**1. "I committed to the wrong branch"**
```bash
git checkout correct-branch
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>  # Copy commit to correct branch
git checkout wrong-branch
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Remove from wrong branch
```

**2. "I pushed something I shouldn't have"**
```bash
# If just pushed (no one else pulled):
git revert <commit-hash>
git push
# Creates new commit that undoes the bad one
```

**3. "My repo is completely broken"**
```bash
# Nuclear option - start fresh (keeps your code):
cd ..
mv old_repo old_repo_backup
git clone <url>
# Manually copy your changes over
```

## Quiz Yourself {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
1. What command shows you what changed in your files?
2. How do you create a new branch?
3. What should a commit message include?
4. What files should go in .gitignore?
5. How do you undo the last commit?
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Answers:**
1. `git diff`
2. `git checkout -b branch-name`
3. What changed and WHY
4. Large files, generated files, secrets
5. `git reset --soft HEAD~1` (or `git commit --amend` if not pushed)

# Wrapping Up {background-color="#9CA898"}

## Key Takeaways {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
1. **Git is essential for modern science** - Reproducibility, collaboration, quality
2. **Commits are snapshots** - Complete project state at a point in time
3. **Branches enable parallel work** - Multiple features/fixes simultaneously
4. **Good practices matter** - Commit messages, READMEs, .gitignore
5. **Code review improves quality** - Catch bugs before they cause problems
6. **Use Git for your homework!** - Practice makes perfect
:::

## What We Didn't Cover {.smaller}

**Advanced topics (for later):**

- Rebasing vs merging
- Stashing changes
- Tags and releases
- Git hooks
- Submodules
- Git LFS (Large File Storage)
- Bisecting to find bugs

::: {.fragment}
**Don't worry!** Master the basics first.
