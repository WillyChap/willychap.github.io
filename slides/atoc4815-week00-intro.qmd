# The Elephant in the Room {background-color="#9CA898"}

## Let's Talk About LLMs / AI {.tiny}

**Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot) are here to stay.**

**My philosophy:**

::: {.incremental .smallest}
1. **AI is a tool, not a crutch**
   - Like a calculator: you still need to understand math
   - Like Stack Overflow: useful, but you need to understand what you're using

2. **You MUST understand the code you submit**
   - I will ask you to explain your solutions
   - Exams are in-person, no AI

3. **AI can help you learn FASTER—if used correctly**
   - Explaining errors
   - Suggesting alternative approaches
   - Finding documentation

4. **AI can also prevent you from learning—if used incorrectly**
   - Copy-pasting without understanding
   - Using it as a "do my homework" button
:::

## AI Use Policy for This Class {.tiny}

##### For the first 8 weeks AI is not permitted 

##### After the first 8 weeks:

::: {.incremental .smallest}
**✅ Allowed:**

- Using AI to explain error messages
- Asking AI to suggest debugging strategies
- Using AI to find relevant documentation
- Using Copilot for autocomplete suggestions
- Discussing concepts with AI (like a study partner)

**❌ Not Allowed:**

- Copy-pasting homework prompts into AI and submitting the output
- Using AI to write entire functions without understanding them
- Relying on AI during exams (they're in-person anyway)

**⚠️ Gray Area → Ask First:**

- Having AI generate starter code
- Using AI to refactor your working code

::: {.fragment}
**Bottom line:** If you can't explain your code line-by-line, you don't understand it well enough.

# Let's Get to Know Each Other {background-color="#9CA898"}

## Interactive Introduction Game {.smaller}

**On the whiteboard, write:**

1. **Your name**
2. **Programming languages you've used** (include "tools" like SQL, Bash, etc.)
3. **Your comfort level** with those languages:

::: {.tiny}
| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0.2 | Can follow examples, modify small things |
| 0.4 | Can write from scratch with docs open |
| 0.6 | Productive, can debug non-trivial issues |
| 0.8 | Could teach it / deep fluency |
| 1.0 | I basically wrote the language |
:::

4. **Mark ✓ if you've used a terminal/command line before**

::: {.fragment}
**Example:**

```
Alice | Python (0.6), MATLAB (0.4), SQL (0.2) | ✓
```
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Grab a marker and add your info!**
:::

## The Question Number System {.scrollable .smaller}

**I had a hard time getting questions answered last semester.**

**New system I'm trying (you're my test subjects):**

When I ask a question in class:

::: {.incremental}
1. **I'll ask the question**
2. **You get 10-20 seconds to think** (maybe jot notes)
3. **I'll say "Ready?"**
4. **You hold up fingers: 0-5**
5. **I scan the room for distribution**
6. **I call on someone to answer**
7. **We hold up numbers again** (did it help?)
:::

**The scale:**

::: {.tiny}
| # | Meaning |
|---|---------|
| 0 | I have no idea |
| 1 | I've heard the term but can't explain it |
| 2 | I have a rough idea but not confident |
| 3 | I could kind of explain it |
| 4 | I can explain it clearly |
| 5 | I could explain it AND give an example or connect it to other things |
:::

## Why This System? {.tiny}

**Traditional classroom problem:**

- Someone asks a question
- Awkward silence
- Same 2-3 students always answer
- Most students don't engage

**This system:**

- ✅ Forces everyone to self-assess
- ✅ Gives me instant feedback on class understanding
- ✅ Reduces pressure (just hold up a number!)
- ✅ Identifies who can help explain to peers
- ✅ Shows when I need to re-explain something

::: {.fragment .tiny}
**If you hate this, tell me!** We can abandon it if it's not working.

**If you love this, also tell me!** I'd like to know it's helpful.
:::

## Let's Try It: Practice Round {.smaller}

**Question:** What is a for loop?

::: {.fragment}
**Take 15 seconds to think...**
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Ready? Show me your numbers: 0-5**
:::

::: {.fragment}
*[I scan the room for distribution]*

*[I call on someone with a 3-4]*

**Answer:** A for loop is a programming construct that repeats a block of code for each item in a sequence (like a list or range). For example, `for i in range(5):` would repeat the indented code 5 times, with i taking values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. It's how we process multiple items without writing the same code over and over.

::: {.fragment}
**Show numbers again—did that help?**

# Getting Started {background-color="#2F2F2F"}

## Today's Setup Tasks {.smaller}

**We need to get your computer ready for the semester:**

::: {.incremental}
1. **Install VS Code** (our code editor)
   - Windows: [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzJCwfYfIzY)
   - Mac: [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0xBQHKjoGo)

2. **Install Git** (version control)
   - Windows users: Install Git Bash
   - Mac users: Git likely already installed

3. **Set up terminal in VS Code**
   - Windows: Use Git Bash
   - Mac: Use default terminal (zsh or bash)

4. **Install conda environment**
   ```bash
   mamba env create -f atoc-2025-lite.yml
   ```
   (This takes ~5 minutes)
:::

## VS Code Extensions (Required) {.smaller}

**Install these extensions today:**

**PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of VS Code extensions panel**
<!-- Add screenshot showing extension marketplace -->

::: {.tiny}
| Extension | ID | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Python | `ms-python.python` | Python language support |
| Pylance | `ms-python.vscode-pylance` | Fast Python IntelliSense |
| Jupyter | `ms-toolsai.jupyter` | Notebook support |
| Ruff | `charliermarsh.ruff` | Fast Python linter |
| Markdown All in One | `yzhang.markdown-all-in-one` | Markdown editing |
:::

**To install:**

1. Open VS Code
2. Click Extensions icon (left sidebar)
3. Search for extension ID
4. Click "Install"

::: {.fragment}
**Need help?** Raise your hand! Will and Aiden will circulate.
:::

## Conda Environment Setup {.tiny}

**What is conda?**

- Package manager for Python
- Creates isolated environments (prevents conflicts)
- Ensures everyone has same versions

**Download the environment file:**

[Canvas → Files → atoc-2025-lite.yml](about:blank)

**Then run:**

```bash
# Navigate to download folder
cd ~/Downloads

# Create environment (takes ~5 min)
mamba env create -f atoc-2025-lite.yml

# Activate environment
conda activate atoc2025

# Verify installation
python --version  # Should see Python 3.11.x
```

## Software Installation Troubleshooting {.tiny .scrollable}

**Common Issues:**

**Issue: "conda: command not found"**

- Solution: Restart terminal after installing
- Or: Add conda to PATH (instructions vary by OS)

**Issue: "Permission denied" on Mac**

- Solution: Use `sudo` before command (requires admin password)

**Issue: Git Bash not showing in VS Code on Windows**

- Solution: Open Settings → Terminal: Integrated → Default Profile → Select "Git Bash"

**Issue: Environment creation fails**

- Solution: Try `conda` instead of `mamba`
- Or: Update conda first: `conda update conda`

**Issue: Extensions won't install**

- Solution: Restart VS Code
- Or: Check internet connection
- Or: Install manually from .vsix file

**Still stuck?** Slack me a screenshot of the error!
