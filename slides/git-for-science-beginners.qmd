# Welcome {background-color="#2F2F2F"}

## Git Is Confusing. That's Normal. {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**If you're thinking any of these:**

- "I have no idea what Git is"
- "I'm afraid I'll break something"
- "The terminal scares me"
- "Why can't I just email my files?"

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**You're in good company.**

- Every scientist felt this way at first
- Git's documentation is notoriously bad
- The terminology is confusing on purpose (it seems)
- **But you only need 5 commands**

:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**By the end of today, you will be able to submit assignments with Git. That's it. That's the goal.**
:::

## What Is Git? {.smaller}

**Git is a save system for your code.**

Think of it like checkpoints in a video game:

::: {.incremental}
- You play the game (write code)
- You hit "save" at important moments (commit)
- If you mess up, you can load a previous save
- Git remembers every save you ever made
:::

::: {.fragment}
**One sentence:** Git tracks changes to your files so you can go back in time if something breaks.
:::


## The 5 Commands {.smaller}

You need **exactly** these 5 commands to survive this course:

| # | Command | Plain English |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 1 | `git clone` | Download a project |
| 2 | `git status` | What changed? (always safe!) |
| 3 | `git add` | Pick files to save |
| 4 | `git commit` | Save a snapshot |
| 5 | `git push` / `git pull` | Upload / Download |

::: {.fragment}
**Everything else is optional.** We'll cover more commands next week. Today is about survival.
:::

## The Safety Guarantee {.smaller}

**You cannot permanently break anything today.**

Why?

::: {.incremental}
- `git status` is 100% read-only. It never changes anything.
- `git add` and `git commit` only save things. They don't delete.
- `git push` uploads your saves. That's it.
- **Worst case scenario:** Delete the folder and clone again. Fresh start in 10 seconds.
:::

::: {.fragment}
**The nuclear option always works:**

```bash
cd ..
rm -rf atoc4815-git-practice
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/atoc4815-git-practice.git
```

If something goes wrong, this fixes it. Every time.
:::

# One-Time Setup {background-color="#9CA898"}

## Configure Git (Do This Once) {.smaller}

**Tell Git who you are** -- this labels your saves with your name:

```bash
# Your name (appears in your commits)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Your CU email (links to your GitHub account)
git config --global user.email "your.email@colorado.edu"
```

::: {.fragment}
**Check that it worked:**

```bash
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

You should see your name and email printed back.
:::

## GitHub Authentication {.smaller .scrollable}

**You need to connect your computer to GitHub** so you can upload (push) your work.

**The easy way -- VS Code handles it for you:**

::: {.incremental}
1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com) (free)
2. The first time you `git push` or `git pull`, VS Code will pop up a browser window
3. Log in to GitHub and click **Authorize**
4. Done! VS Code remembers your login.
:::

::: {.fragment}
**If you're using the terminal outside VS Code:**

- **Mac:** Git will use the macOS Keychain. The first time you push, it asks for your GitHub username and a **Personal Access Token** (not your password). Generate one at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
- **Windows:** Git for Windows includes **Git Credential Manager** which pops up a login window automatically.
- **Linux:** Run `git config --global credential.helper store` so Git remembers your token after the first time.
:::

## Installing Git {.smaller}

**Check if Git is already installed:**

```bash
git --version
```

If you see a version number (e.g., `git version 2.39.0`), you're good!

::: {.fragment}
**If not installed:**

| Platform | How to install |
|----------|---------------|
| **Mac** | Open Terminal, type `git`. macOS will prompt you to install Xcode Command Line Tools. Click **Install**. |
| **Windows** | Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Use all default settings. This gives you **Git Bash**. |
| **Linux** | `sudo apt install git` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo dnf install git` (Fedora) |
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Mac users:** If you already installed Homebrew, `brew install git` works too.
:::

## Using Git in VS Code: The Terminal {.smaller}

**VS Code has a built-in terminal -- this is where you'll run Git commands.**

**Open it:**

- Keyboard: `` Ctrl+` `` (backtick key, below Escape)
- Menu: **Terminal > New Terminal**
- Mac shortcut: `` Cmd+` ``

::: {.fragment}
The terminal appears at the bottom of VS Code. It works exactly like a standalone terminal.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  VS Code Editor                     │
│  (your code here)                   │
│                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  TERMINAL                           │
│  $ git status                       │
│  On branch main                     │
│  nothing to commit, working tree    │
│  clean                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Tip:** Make sure the terminal is in your project folder! Check with `pwd` (Mac/Linux) or `cd` (Windows).
:::

## Using Git in VS Code: Source Control Panel {.smaller}

**VS Code also has a visual Git interface** -- no terminal needed for basic operations.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Open it:**

- Click the **branch icon** in the left sidebar (3rd icon)
- Or press `Ctrl+Shift+G` (`Cmd+Shift+G` on Mac)

**What you'll see:**

- **Changes** -- files you modified (like `git status`)
- **`+` button** next to a file -- stages it (like `git add`)
- **Message box** at top -- type your commit message
- **Checkmark button** -- commits (like `git commit`)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**The visual workflow:**

1. Edit files normally
2. Open Source Control panel
3. Click `+` next to changed files
4. Type a commit message
5. Click the checkmark to commit
6. Click `...` menu > **Push** to upload

:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Use whichever you prefer!** Terminal commands and the Source Control panel do the same thing. This course teaches terminal commands because they work everywhere (servers, other editors, etc.).
:::

## Practice Checkpoint: Setup {.smaller}

**Do this now** (raise your hand if you need help):

::: {.incremental}
1. Open VS Code and open the built-in terminal (`` Ctrl+` ``)
2. Check Git is installed: `git --version`
3. Run `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` (use your real name)
4. Run `git config --global user.email "you@colorado.edu"` (use your CU email)
5. Verify: `git config --global user.name` prints your name
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Done?** Give me a thumbs up. We'll wait for everyone.
:::

# Command 1: Fork + Clone {background-color="#2F2F2F"}

## First: Fork the Repository {.smaller}

**Forking makes your own personal copy on GitHub** that you have full permission to push to.

::: {.incremental}
1. Go to [github.com/WillyChap/atoc4815-git-practice](https://github.com/WillyChap/atoc4815-git-practice)
2. Click the **Fork** button (top right)
3. Click **Create fork**
4. You now have your own copy at `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/atoc4815-git-practice`
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Why fork?** The original repo belongs to the instructor. You can't push to it. Your fork belongs to **you** -- push all you want!
:::

## `git clone` = Download Your Fork {.smaller}

**Clone copies your fork from GitHub to your computer:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/atoc4815-git-practice.git
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

::: {.fragment}
**What just happened?**

- Git created a new folder called `atoc4815-git-practice`
- It downloaded all the files from your fork
- It set up a connection back to **your fork** (so you can push later)
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Now move into the folder:**

```bash
cd atoc4815-git-practice
```
:::

## What's Inside? {.smaller}

```bash
atoc4815-git-practice/
    README.md                    # Project description
    boulder_temperatures.py      # Exercise 1
    denver_wind_analysis.py      # Exercise 2
    data/
        boulder_jan2025.csv      # Boulder temperature data
        denver_wind_jan2025.csv  # Denver wind speed data
```

::: {.fragment}
**There's also a hidden folder:**

```bash
.git/     # Git's database -- don't touch this!
```

Git stores all its history in `.git/`. You never need to open it.
:::

## Practice Checkpoint: Fork + Clone {.smaller}

**Do this now:**

::: {.incremental}
1. Go to [github.com/WillyChap/atoc4815-git-practice](https://github.com/WillyChap/atoc4815-git-practice) and click **Fork**
2. Open your terminal (VS Code: `` Ctrl+` ``)
3. Navigate to where you want the project: `cd ~/ATOC4815`
4. Clone **your fork**: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/atoc4815-git-practice.git`
5. Run: `cd atoc4815-git-practice`
6. Run: `ls` -- you should see the files listed on the previous slide
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Raise your hand if you see the files. If not, let's troubleshoot.**
:::

# Command 2: Status {background-color="#9CA898"}

## `git status` = Your Safety Net {.smaller}

**This is the most important command. It is 100% safe. It never changes anything.**

```bash
git status
```

Run it **all the time**. Before you do anything. After you do anything. When you're confused. When you're not confused. Just run it.

::: {.fragment}
**Right now, it should say:**

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Translation:** "Everything is saved. Nothing has changed."
:::

## Make a Change, Then Check Status {.smaller}

**Open `boulder_temperatures.py` in your editor and add your name:**

```python
# TODO: Add your name here
STUDENT_NAME = "Alice Johnson"  # <-- put YOUR name
```

::: {.fragment}
**Save the file, then run:**

```bash
git status
```

Now it says:

```
Changes not staged for commit:
    modified:   boulder_temperatures.py
```

**Translation:** "You changed `boulder_temperatures.py` but haven't saved it to Git yet."
:::

## Reading `git status` -- Translation Table {.smaller}

| Git says... | Translation |
|------------|-------------|
| `nothing to commit, working tree clean` | Everything is saved. You're good! |
| `Changes not staged for commit` | You changed files but haven't told Git yet |
| `Changes to be committed` | Files are staged and ready to save |
| `Untracked files` | New files that Git doesn't know about yet |
| `Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main'` | You saved locally but haven't uploaded to GitHub |

::: {.fragment}
**Don't memorize this.** Just run `git status` and read the output. Git actually tells you what to do next!
:::

## Practice Checkpoint: Status {.smaller}

**Do this now:**

::: {.incremental}
1. Run `git status` -- should say "clean"
2. Open `boulder_temperatures.py` and add your name to `STUDENT_NAME`
3. Save the file
4. Run `git status` again -- should say "modified: boulder_temperatures.py"
:::

::: {.fragment}
**See the change? That means Git is tracking your work.**
:::

# Commands 3 & 4: Add + Commit {background-color="#2F2F2F"}

## Saving in Git is Two Steps {.smaller}

**Why two steps?** Think of it like mailing a package:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Step 1: `git add`**

Pack items into the box

- Pick which files to include
- You can add one file or many
- Nothing is saved yet!

```bash
git add boulder_temperatures.py
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Step 2: `git commit`**

Seal the box and write a label

- Saves a snapshot of everything you added
- Include a message describing what you did
- This is your "checkpoint"

```bash
git commit -m "Add my name"
```
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Why not one step?** Sometimes you change 5 files but only want to save 3 of them. `git add` lets you pick.
:::

## `git add` in Detail {.smaller}

**Stage specific files:**

```bash
# Add one file
git add boulder_temperatures.py

# Add multiple files
git add boulder_temperatures.py denver_wind_analysis.py

# Add ALL changed files (use with care)
git add .
```

::: {.fragment}
**After `git add`, run `git status`:**

```
Changes to be committed:
    modified:   boulder_temperatures.py
```

**Translation:** "This file is packed in the box, ready to be saved."
:::

## `git commit` in Detail {.smaller}

**Save a snapshot with a message:**

```bash
git commit -m "Add my name to boulder temperature analysis"
```

::: {.fragment}
The `-m` flag means "message." The message goes in quotes.

**After committing, run `git status`:**

```
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Translation:** "Everything is saved. You're good!"
:::

## Good vs Bad Commit Messages {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Good messages:**

```bash
git commit -m "Add my name"

git commit -m "Calculate average high temp"

git commit -m "Fix wind speed calculation"

git commit -m "Complete exercise 2"
```

Short, describes what you did.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Bad messages:**

```bash
git commit -m "stuff"

git commit -m "asdf"

git commit -m "."

git commit -m "idk"
```

Nobody (including future you) knows what changed.
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Rule of thumb:** Start with a verb. What did you DO?

Add, Fix, Update, Complete, Remove, Implement...
:::

## The Mantra: Status-Add-Commit-Status {.smaller}

**Every time you finish a chunk of work, do this:**

```bash
git status                    # 1. What changed?
git add myfile.py             # 2. Stage it
git commit -m "What I did"    # 3. Save it
git status                    # 4. Confirm it worked
```

::: {.fragment}
**The bookend `git status` calls are your safety net:**

- **Before:** Make sure you know what you're saving
- **After:** Confirm everything is clean
:::

::: {.fragment}
Say it with me: **Status. Add. Commit. Status.**
:::

## Practice Checkpoint: Add + Commit {.smaller}

**Do this now** (you should already have your name in `boulder_temperatures.py`):

::: {.incremental}
1. `git status` -- see your modified file
2. `git add boulder_temperatures.py`
3. `git status` -- file should now be "staged" (green)
4. `git commit -m "Add my name to boulder analysis"`
5. `git status` -- should say "working tree clean"
:::

::: {.fragment}
**You just made your first commit! That's a real Git save point.**
:::

# Command 5: Push & Pull {background-color="#9CA898"}

## Your Computer vs GitHub {.smaller}

**Git has two copies of your project:**

```
    Your Computer                    GitHub
    (local)                          (remote)
   ┌──────────────┐                ┌──────────────┐
   │ Your files    │    git push    │ Your files    │
   │ Your commits  │ ────────────> │ Your commits  │
   │               │               │               │
   │               │   git pull    │               │
   │               │ <──────────── │               │
   └──────────────┘                └──────────────┘
```

::: {.fragment}
- **`git push`** = Upload your commits to GitHub
- **`git pull`** = Download any updates from GitHub
:::

## `git push` = Upload to GitHub {.smaller}

**After committing, upload your work:**

```bash
git push
```

::: {.fragment}
That's it. One command.

**What happens:**

- Your commits are copied to GitHub
- Anyone with access can see them
- Your work is backed up in the cloud
:::

::: {.fragment}
**If `git push` fails**, it usually means you need to `git pull` first (someone else pushed changes). We'll deal with that later -- for now, you're the only person working on this repo.
:::

## `git pull` = Download from GitHub {.smaller}

**If you work on multiple computers, or if the instructor updates something:**

```bash
git pull
```

::: {.fragment}
**What happens:**

- Downloads any new commits from GitHub
- Updates your local files
- Run this at the start of a work session
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Simple rule:**

- `git pull` when you SIT DOWN to work
- `git push` when you STAND UP from working
:::

## Practice Checkpoint: Push {.smaller}

**Do this now:**

::: {.incremental}
1. Make sure your earlier commit is saved: `git status` (should be clean)
2. Push to GitHub: `git push`
3. Check status: `git status`
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Go to your fork on GitHub in your browser:**

`github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/atoc4815-git-practice`

Can you see your commit? (Look at the commit history -- your fork is yours, so your push always works!)
:::

# The Complete Workflow {background-color="#2F2F2F"}

## All 5 Commands, One Page {.smaller}

| Step | Command | When | Safe? |
|------|---------|------|-------|
| 0 | `git clone <url>` | Once, to download the project | Yes |
| 1 | `git status` | All the time! Before and after everything | 100% |
| 2 | `git add <file>` | When you want to stage changes | Yes |
| 3 | `git commit -m "msg"` | When you want to save a snapshot | Yes |
| 4 | `git push` | When you want to upload to GitHub | Yes |
| 4 | `git pull` | When you want to download from GitHub | Yes |

::: {.fragment}
**That's the whole thing.** Everything else is bonus.
:::

## Your Daily Homework Workflow {.smaller}

```bash
# Start of session
cd ~/ATOC4815/homework-3
git pull                              # Get any updates

# ... do your work in your editor ...

# When you finish a chunk
git status                            # What changed?
git add homework3_problem1.py         # Stage it
git commit -m "Solve problem 1"       # Save it
git status                            # Confirm

# ... do more work ...

git status
git add homework3_problem2.py
git commit -m "Solve problem 2"
git status

# End of session
git push                              # Upload everything
```

## The Nuclear Option {.smaller}

**If something goes horribly wrong:**

```bash
# Step 1: Get out of the folder
cd ..

# Step 2: Rename (don't delete yet -- save your work!)
mv atoc4815-git-practice atoc4815-git-practice-broken

# Step 3: Clone your fork fresh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/atoc4815-git-practice.git

# Step 4: Copy your work back
cp atoc4815-git-practice-broken/boulder_temperatures.py atoc4815-git-practice/

# Step 5: Add, commit, push in the fresh clone
cd atoc4815-git-practice
git add .
git commit -m "Re-add my work after fresh clone"
git push
```

::: {.fragment}
**This always works.** It's not elegant, but it gets the job done. No shame in using it.
:::

## DON'T PANIC {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Things that feel scary but are fine:**

- Red text in `git status` -- just means "not staged yet"
- "Your branch is ahead" -- just means "you need to push"
- "Untracked files" -- just means "new files Git doesn't know about"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**If you're stuck, do this:**

1. Run `git status`
2. Read the output carefully
3. Git usually tells you what to do next
4. If confused, ask a classmate or raise your hand
5. If really stuck, use the nuclear option
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Remember: you cannot break anything that can't be fixed by cloning again.**
:::

# Full Practice Exercise {background-color="#9CA898"}

## Exercise: Complete the Denver Wind Analysis {.smaller}

**Open `denver_wind_analysis.py` and complete the TODO sections:**

::: {.incremental}
1. `average_wind_speed()` -- calculate the average of `avg_wind_mph` across all days
2. `count_advisory_days()` -- count days where `avg_wind_mph > 25`
3. `windiest_day()` -- find the date with the highest `max_gust_mph`
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Test your code:**

```bash
python denver_wind_analysis.py
```
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Then save it with Git:**

```bash
git status
git add denver_wind_analysis.py
git commit -m "Complete denver wind analysis"
git push
```
:::

## Exercise Hints {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Average wind speed:**

```python
total = 0
for day in data:
    total += day["avg_wind_mph"]
result = total / len(data)
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Count advisory days:**

```python
count = 0
for day in data:
    if day["avg_wind_mph"] > threshold:
        count += 1
result = count
```
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Windiest day:**

```python
max_gust = 0
max_date = ""
for day in data:
    if day["max_gust_mph"] > max_gust:
        max_gust = day["max_gust_mph"]
        max_date = day["date"]
result = (max_date, max_gust)
```
:::

## What's Coming Next {.smaller}

**Today:** 5 commands to survive (clone, status, add, commit, push/pull)

**Next time:** The full Git toolkit

::: {.incremental}
- **Branches** -- work on multiple things at once
- **Merge conflicts** -- what happens when two people edit the same file
- **Pull requests** -- how to propose changes on GitHub
- **`.gitignore`** -- telling Git to skip certain files
- **History** -- looking at past commits with `git log`
:::

# Resources {background-color="#2F2F2F"}

## Cheat Sheet {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**100% Safe (read-only):**

```bash
git status     # What changed?
git log        # History of saves
```

These never change anything. Run them whenever you want.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Action Commands (do things):**

```bash
git clone <url>          # Download project
git add <file>           # Stage for saving
git commit -m "msg"      # Save snapshot
git push                 # Upload to GitHub
git pull                 # Download from GitHub
```

These make changes. Use the mantra:
**Status. Add. Commit. Status.**
:::
:::

## Getting Help {.smaller}

**When you're stuck:**

::: {.incremental}
1. Run `git status` and read the output
2. Check the [practice repo README](https://github.com/WillyChap/atoc4815-git-practice) for the cheat sheet
3. Ask a classmate
4. Come to office hours: Tu 11:15-12:15p, Th 9-10a (Aerospace Cafe)
5. Email: wchapman@colorado.edu
:::

**Useful websites:**

- [Oh Shit, Git!](https://ohshitgit.com/) -- fixes for common mistakes (real name of a real website)
- [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/) -- official documentation

:::

## Status. Add. Commit. Push. {.smaller}

::: {style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2em;"}

**That's it (for today).**

```bash
git status
git add <file>
git commit -m "What I did"
git push
```

You now know enough to Git crazy.

Everything else is a bonus.
