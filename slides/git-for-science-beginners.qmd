## Git Is Confusing. {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**If you're thinking any of these:**

- "I have no idea what Git is"
- "I'm afraid I'll break something / lose my work"
- "Why can't I just email my files?"

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**You're in good company.**

- Most scientists feel this way, and don't use it
  - this is a bad perspective
- Git's documentation is notoriously bad
- The terminology is confusing on purpose (it seems)
- **For today, you only need 5 commands**

:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**By the end of today the goal is to be able to submit assignments with Git.**
:::

## What Is Git? {.smaller}

**Git is a save system for your code.**

Think of it like checkpoints in a video game:

::: {.incremental}
- You play the game (write code)
- You hit "save" at important moments (commit)
- If you mess up, you can load a previous save
- Git remembers every save you ever made
:::

::: {.fragment}
**In Summary:** Git tracks changes to your files so you can go back in time if something breaks.
:::

## Git vs GitHub (Not the Same Thing) {.smaller}

| | **Git** | **GitHub** |
|---|---------|-----------|
| What | Tool on your computer | Website (github.com) |
| Does | Tracks changes to files | Hosts repositories online |
| Needs internet? | No | Yes |

::: {.fragment}
**Git** is the time machine. **GitHub** is the cloud backup.

You can use Git without GitHub (just local saves). You can't use GitHub without Git.
:::

## The 5 Commands {.smaller}

Today, you need **exactly** these 5 commands:

| # | Command | Plain English |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 1 | `git clone` | Download a project |
| 2 | `git status` | What changed? (always safe!) |
| 3 | `git add` | Pick files to save |
| 4 | `git commit` | Save a snapshot |
| 5 | `git push` / `git pull` | Upload / Download |

::: {.fragment}
We'll cover more commands next week.
:::

## The Safety Guarantee {.smaller}

**You cannot permanently break anything today.**

Why?

::: {.incremental}
- `git status` is 100% read-only. It never changes anything.
- `git add` and `git commit` only save things. They don't delete.
- `git push` uploads your saves. 
- **Worst case scenario:** Delete the folder and clone again. Fresh start in 10 seconds.
:::

::: {.fragment}
**The nuclear option always works:**

```bash
cd ..
rm -rf atoc4815-git-practice
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/atoc4815-git-practice.git
```

If something goes wrong, this fixes it. Every time.

**Warning:** `rm -rf` permanently deletes files — no trash can, no undo. Always double-check you're in the right folder first: run `pwd` and `ls` before deleting anything.
:::

# One-Time Setup {background-color="#9CA898"}

## Installing Git {.smaller}

**Check if Git is already installed:**

```bash
git --version
```

If you see a version number (e.g., `git version 2.39.0`), you're good!

::: {.fragment}
**If not installed:**

| Platform | How to install |
|----------|---------------|
| **Mac** | Open Terminal, type `git`. macOS will prompt you to install Xcode Command Line Tools. Click **Install**. |
| **Windows** | Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Use all default settings. This gives you **Git Bash**. |
| **Linux** | `sudo apt install git` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo dnf install git` (Fedora) |
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Mac users:** If you already installed Homebrew, `brew install git` works too.
:::

## Configure Git (Do This Once) {.smaller}

**Tell Git who you are** -- this labels your saves with your name:

```bash
# Your name (appears in your commits)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Your CU email (links to your GitHub account)
git config --global user.email "your.email@colorado.edu"
```

::: {.fragment}
**Check that it worked:**

```bash
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

You should see your name and email printed back.
:::

## GitHub Authentication {.smaller .scrollable}

**You need to connect your computer to GitHub** so you can upload (push) your work.

**The easy way -- VS Code handles it for you:**

::: {.incremental}
1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com) (free)
2. The first time you `git push` or `git pull`, VS Code will pop up a browser window
3. Log in to GitHub and click **Authorize**
4. Done! VS Code remembers your login.
:::

::: {.fragment}
**What this looks like:** A browser tab opens asking you to sign in to GitHub. You'll see a page titled "Authorize Visual Studio Code." Click the green **Authorize** button. The browser will say "You can close this tab" — done!
:::

::: {.fragment}
**What about the terminal?** Modern Git on Mac and Windows includes **Git Credential Manager**, which also opens a browser window automatically — same process, no token needed. If you're asked for a "password" in the terminal, it means your Git is outdated — come to office hours and we'll update it.
:::

## Using Git in VS Code: The Terminal {.smallest}

**VS Code has a built-in terminal -- this is where you'll run Git commands.**

**Open it:**

- Keyboard: `` Ctrl+` `` (backtick key, below Escape)
- Menu: **Terminal > New Terminal**
- Mac shortcut: `` Cmd+` ``

::: {.fragment}
The terminal appears at the bottom of VS Code. It works exactly like a standalone terminal.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  VS Code Editor                     │
│  (your code here)                   │
│                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  TERMINAL                           │
│  $ git status                       │
│  On branch main                     │
│  nothing to commit, working tree    │
│  clean                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Tip:** Make sure the terminal is in your project folder! Check with `pwd` (Mac/Linux) or `cd` (Windows).
:::

## Using Git in VS Code: Source Control Panel {.smallest .scrollable}

**VS Code also has a visual Git interface** -- no terminal needed for basic operations.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" .small}
**Open it:**

- Click the **branch icon** in the left sidebar (3rd icon)
- Or press `Ctrl+Shift+G` (`Cmd+Shift+G` on Mac)

**What you'll see:**

- **Changes** -- files you modified (like `git status`)
- **`+` button** next to a file -- stages it (like `git add`)
- **Message box** at top -- type your commit message
- **Checkmark button** -- commits (like `git commit`)
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .small}
**The visual workflow:**

1. Edit files normally
2. Open Source Control panel
3. Click `+` next to changed files
4. Type a commit message
5. Click the checkmark to commit
6. Click `...` menu > **Push** to upload

:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Use whichever you prefer!** Terminal commands and the Source Control panel do the same thing. This course teaches terminal commands because they work everywhere (servers, other editors, etc.).
:::

## Practice Checkpoint: Setup {.smaller}

**Do this now** :

::: {.incremental}
1. Open VS Code and open the built-in terminal (`` Ctrl+` ``)
2. Check Git is installed: `git --version`
3. Run `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` (use your real name)
4. Run `git config --global user.email "you@colorado.edu"` (use your CU email)
5. Verify: `git config --global user.name` prints your name
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Done?** Give me a thumbs up.
:::

# Command 1: Fork + Clone {background-color="#2F2F2F"}

## First: Fork the Repository {.smaller}

**Forking makes your own personal copy on GitHub** that you have full permission to push to.

::: {.incremental}
1. Go to [github.com/WillyChap/atoc4815-git-practice](https://github.com/WillyChap/atoc4815-git-practice)
2. Click the **Fork** button (top right)
3. Click **Create fork**
4. You now have your own copy at `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/atoc4815-git-practice`
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Why fork?** The original repo belongs to me. You can't push to it. Your fork belongs to **you**, thus you can make changes!
:::

## `git clone` = Download Your Fork {.smaller}

**Clone copies your fork from GitHub to your computer:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/atoc4815-git-practice.git
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

::: {.fragment}
**What just happened?**

- Git created a new folder called `atoc4815-git-practice`
- It downloaded all the files from your fork
- It set up a connection back to **your fork** (so you can push later)
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Now move into the folder:**

```bash
cd atoc4815-git-practice
```
:::

## What's Inside? {.smaller}

```bash
atoc4815-git-practice/
    README.md                    # Project description
    boulder_temperatures.py      # Exercise 1
    denver_wind_analysis.py      # Exercise 2
    data/
        boulder_jan2025.csv      # Boulder temperature data
        denver_wind_jan2025.csv  # Denver wind speed data
```

::: {.fragment}
**There's also a hidden folder:**

```bash
.git/     # Git's database -- don't touch this!
```

Git stores all its history in `.git/`. You never need to open it.
:::

## Practice Checkpoint: Fork + Clone {.smaller}

**Do this now:**

::: {.incremental}
1. Go to [github.com/WillyChap/atoc4815-git-practice](https://github.com/WillyChap/atoc4815-git-practice) and click **Fork**
2. Open your terminal (VS Code: `` Ctrl+` ``)
3. Navigate to where you want the project: `cd ~/ATOC4815`
4. Clone **your fork**: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/atoc4815-git-practice.git`
5. Run: `cd atoc4815-git-practice`
6. Run: `ls` -- you should see the files listed on the previous slide
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Raise your hand if you see the files. If not, let's troubleshoot.**
:::

# Command 2: Status {background-color="#9CA898"}

## `git status` = Your Safety Net {.smaller}

**This is the most important command. It is 100% safe. It never changes anything.**

```bash
git status
```

Run it **all the time**. Before you do anything. After you do anything. When you're confused. When you're not confused. Just run it.

::: {.fragment}
**Right now, it should say:**

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Translation:** "Everything is saved. Nothing has changed."
:::

## Make a Change, Then Check Status {.smaller}

**Open `boulder_temperatures.py` in your editor and add your name:**

```python
# TODO: Add your name here
STUDENT_NAME = "Alice Johnson"  # <-- put YOUR name
```

::: {.fragment}
**Save the file, then run:**

```bash
git status
```

Now it says:

```
Changes not staged for commit:
    modified:   boulder_temperatures.py
```

**Translation:** "You changed `boulder_temperatures.py` but haven't saved it to Git yet."
:::

## Reading `git status` -- Translation Table {.smaller}

| Git says... | Translation |
|------------|-------------|
| `nothing to commit, working tree clean` | Everything is saved. You're good! |
| `Changes not staged for commit` | You changed files but haven't told Git yet |
| `Changes to be committed` | Files are staged and ready to save |
| `Untracked files` | New files that Git doesn't know about yet |
| `Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main'` | You saved locally but haven't uploaded to GitHub |

::: {.fragment}
**Don't memorize this.** Just run `git status` and read the output. Git actually tells you what to do next!
:::

## Practice Checkpoint: Status {.smaller}

**Do this now:**

::: {.incremental}
1. Run `git status` -- should say "clean"
2. Open `boulder_temperatures.py` and add your name to `STUDENT_NAME`
3. Save the file
4. Run `git status` again -- should say "modified: boulder_temperatures.py"
:::

::: {.fragment}
**See the change? That means Git is tracking your work.**
:::

# Commands 3 & 4: Add + Commit {background-color="#2F2F2F"}

## Saving in Git is Two Steps {.smaller}

**Why two steps?** Think of it like mailing a package:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Step 1: `git add`**

Pack items into the box

- Pick which files to include
- You can add one file or many
- Nothing is saved yet!

```bash
git add boulder_temperatures.py
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Step 2: `git commit`**

Seal the box and write a label

- Saves a snapshot of everything you added
- Include a message describing what you did
- This is your "checkpoint"

```bash
git commit -m "Add my name"
```
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Why not one step?** Sometimes you change 5 files but only want to save 3 of them. `git add` lets you pick.
:::

## `git add` in Detail {.smaller}

**Stage specific files:**

```bash
# Add one file
git add boulder_temperatures.py

# Add multiple files
git add boulder_temperatures.py denver_wind_analysis.py

# Add ALL changed files (use with care!)
git add .
```

::: {.fragment}
**After `git add`, run `git status`:**

```
Changes to be committed:
    modified:   boulder_temperatures.py
```

**Translation:** "This file is packed in the box, ready to be saved."
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Heads up about `git add .`:** This adds *everything* — including junk files like `__pycache__/`, `.DS_Store`, and temporary files. For now, **add files by name**. Next week we'll learn `.gitignore` to handle this properly.
:::

## `git commit` in Detail {.smaller}

**Save a snapshot with a message:**

```bash
git commit -m "Add my name to boulder temperature analysis"
```

::: {.fragment}
The `-m` flag means "message." The message goes in quotes.

**After committing, run `git status`:**

```
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Translation:** "Everything is saved. You're good!"
:::

## Good vs Bad Commit Messages {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Good messages:**

```bash
git commit -m "Add my name"

git commit -m "Calculate average high temp"

git commit -m "Fix wind speed calculation"

git commit -m "Complete exercise 2"
```

Short, describes what you did.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Bad messages:**

```bash
git commit -m "stuff"

git commit -m "asdf"

git commit -m "."

git commit -m "idk"
```

Nobody (including future you) knows what changed.
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Rule of thumb:** Start with a verb. What did you DO?

Add, Fix, Update, Complete, Remove, Implement...
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Commit size rule:** If your commit message needs more than one sentence, you probably waited too long to commit. **Commit early. Commit often.**
:::

## The Mantra: Status-Add-Commit-Status {.smaller}

**Every time you finish a chunk of work, do this:**

```bash
git status                    # 1. What changed?
git add myfile.py             # 2. Stage it
git commit -m "What I did"    # 3. Save it
git status                    # 4. Confirm it worked
```

::: {.fragment}
**The bookend `git status` calls are your safety net:**

- **Before:** Make sure you know what you're saving
- **After:** Confirm everything is clean
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Status. Add. Commit. Status.**
:::

## Common Beginner Mistake {.smaller}

**You will do this at least once:**

```bash
git commit -m "Add analysis"
```

```
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

::: {.fragment}
**Why?** You forgot `git add`. The commit had nothing to save!

**Fix:**

```bash
git add myfile.py
git commit -m "Add analysis"
```

This is normal. Everyone does it. Just run `git status` and you'll see the file is still unstaged.
:::

## Practice Checkpoint: Add + Commit {.smaller}

**Do this now** (you should already have your name in `boulder_temperatures.py`):

::: {.incremental}
1. `git status` -- see your modified file
2. `git add boulder_temperatures.py`
3. `git status` -- file should now be "staged" (green)
4. `git commit -m "Add my name to boulder analysis"`
5. `git status` -- should say "working tree clean"
6. `git log --oneline` -- see your save in the history!
:::

::: {.fragment}
**You just made your first commit!** Run `git log --oneline` — you should see something like:

```
a1b2c3d Add my name to boulder analysis
f4e5d6c Initial commit
```

That's your save history. Every commit you make shows up here.

You can also try `git log --oneline --graph` — even in simple projects, this shows how your saves build over time.
:::

# Command 5: Push & Pull {background-color="#9CA898"}

## Your Computer vs GitHub {.smaller}

**Git has two copies of your project:**

```
    Your Computer                    GitHub
    (local)                          (remote)
   ┌──────────────┐                ┌──────────────┐
   │ Your files    │    git push    │ Your files    │
   │ Your commits  │ ────────────> │ Your commits  │
   │               │               │               │
   │               │   git pull    │               │
   │               │ <──────────── │               │
   └──────────────┘                └──────────────┘
```

::: {.fragment}
- **`git push`** = Upload your commits to GitHub
- **`git pull`** = Download any updates from GitHub
:::

## `git push` = Upload to GitHub {.smaller}

**After committing, upload your work:**

```bash
git push
```

::: {.fragment}

**What happens:**

- Your commits are copied to GitHub
- Anyone with access can see them
- Your work is backed up in the cloud
:::

::: {.fragment}
**If `git push` fails**, it usually means you need to `git pull` first (someone else pushed changes). We'll deal with that later -- for now, you're the only person working on this repo.
:::

## `git pull` = Download from GitHub {.smaller}

**If you work on multiple computers, or if the I update something:**

```bash
git pull
```

::: {.fragment}
**What happens:**

- Downloads any new commits from GitHub
- Updates your local files
- Run this at the start of a work session
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Simple rule:**

- `git pull` when you SIT DOWN to work
- `git push` when you STAND UP from working
:::

## Practice Checkpoint: Push {.smaller}

**Do this now:**

::: {.incremental}
1. Make sure your earlier commit is saved: `git status` (should be clean)
2. Push to GitHub: `git push`
3. Check status: `git status`
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Go to your fork on GitHub in your browser:**

`github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/atoc4815-git-practice`

Can you see your commit? (Look at the commit history -- your fork is yours, so your push always works!)
:::

## Practice Checkpoint: Pull {.smaller}

**Now let's practice `git pull` — make a change on GitHub, then download it:**

::: {.incremental}
1. On GitHub, open your fork's `README.md` and click the **pencil icon** (edit)
2. Add a line at the bottom: `Edited on GitHub by [your name]`
3. Click **Commit changes** (green button) — this commits directly on GitHub
4. Back in your terminal: `git pull`
5. Open `README.md` locally — your edit from GitHub is now on your laptop!
:::

::: {.fragment}
**That's the full loop:** push uploads, pull downloads. You'll use `git pull` every time you sit down to work.
:::

# The Complete Workflow {background-color="#2F2F2F"}

## All 5 Commands, One Page {.smaller}

| Step | Command | When | Safe? |
|------|---------|------|-------|
| 0 | `git clone <url>` | Once, to download the project | Yes |
| 1 | `git status` | All the time! Before and after everything | 100% |
| 2 | `git add <file>` | When you want to stage changes | Yes |
| 3 | `git commit -m "msg"` | When you want to save a snapshot | Yes |
| 4 | `git push` | When you want to upload to GitHub | Yes |
| 4 | `git pull` | When you want to download from GitHub | Yes |


## Your Daily Homework Workflow {.smaller}

```bash
# Start of session
cd ~/ATOC4815/homework-3
git pull                              # Get any updates

# ... do your work in your editor ...

# When you finish a chunk
git status                            # What changed?
git add homework3_problem1.py         # Stage it
git commit -m "Solve problem 1"       # Save it
git status                            # Confirm

# ... do more work ...

git status
git add homework3_problem2.py
git commit -m "Solve problem 2"
git status

# End of session
git push                              # Upload everything
```

## The Nuclear Option {.smaller}

**If something goes horribly wrong:**

```bash
# Step 1: Get out of the folder
cd ..

# Step 2: Rename (don't delete yet -- save your work!)
mv atoc4815-git-practice atoc4815-git-practice-broken

# Step 3: Clone your fork fresh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/atoc4815-git-practice.git

# Step 4: Copy ALL your work back
cp atoc4815-git-practice-broken/*.py atoc4815-git-practice/

# Step 5: Add, commit, push in the fresh clone
cd atoc4815-git-practice
git add .
git commit -m "Re-add my work after fresh clone"
git push
```

::: {.fragment}
**This always works.**
:::

## DON'T PANIC {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Things that feel scary but are fine:**

- Red text in `git status` -- just means "not staged yet"
- "Your branch is ahead" -- just means "you need to push"
- "Untracked files" -- just means "new files Git doesn't know about"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**If you're stuck, do this:**

1. Run `git status`
2. Read the output carefully
3. Git usually tells you what to do next
4. If confused, ask a classmate or raise your hand
5. If really stuck, use the nuclear option
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Remember: you cannot break anything that can't be fixed by cloning again.**
:::

# Full Practice Exercise {background-color="#9CA898"}

## Exercise: The Full Git Cycle {.smallest}

**This exercise is about practicing the Git workflow. The Python is straightforward — focus on the commands.**

Open `denver_wind_analysis.py` and complete the three TODO functions. You already know how to do this (Week 1–2 Python).

::: {.fragment .smaller}
**The real exercise — commit after EACH function, not all at once:**

```bash
# Function 1: average_wind_speed()
# ... write the code, test with: python denver_wind_analysis.py ...
git status
git add denver_wind_analysis.py
git commit -m "Implement average wind speed calculation"

# Function 2: count_advisory_days()
# ... write the code, test ...
git add denver_wind_analysis.py
git commit -m "Add advisory day counter"

# Function 3: windiest_day()
# ... write the code, test ...
git add denver_wind_analysis.py
git commit -m "Add windiest day finder"

# Upload all three commits at once
git push
```
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Check your history:** `git log --oneline` — you should see 3 new commits, each describing one function. This is what "commit early, commit often" looks like.
:::

## Exercise: Verify on GitHub {.smaller}

**After pushing, go to your fork on GitHub:**

`github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/atoc4815-git-practice`

::: {.incremental}
1. Click on **commits** — do you see your 3 separate commits?
2. Click on one commit — GitHub shows you exactly what changed (green = added, red = removed)
3. This is why good commit messages matter — you can see your work history at a glance
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Bonus:** Click on `denver_wind_analysis.py` on GitHub, then click **Blame** (right side). This shows who wrote each line and when. Imagine this with 5 collaborators — that's why Git exists.
:::

## What's Coming Next {.smaller}

**Today:** 5 commands (clone, status, add, commit, push/pull)

**Next time:** The full Git toolkit

::: {.incremental}
- **Branches** -- work on multiple things at once

## Cheat Sheet {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**100% Safe (read-only):**

```bash
git status     # What changed?
git log        # History of saves
```

These never change anything. Run them whenever you want.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Action Commands (do things):**

```bash
git clone <url>          # Download project
git add <file>           # Stage for saving
git commit -m "msg"      # Save snapshot
git push                 # Upload to GitHub
git pull                 # Download from GitHub
```

These make changes. Use the mantra:
**Status. Add. Commit. Status.**

## Getting Help {.smaller}

**When you're stuck:**

::: {.incremental}
1. Run `git status` and read the output
2. Check the [practice repo README](https://github.com/WillyChap/atoc4815-git-practice) for the cheat sheet
3. Ask a classmate
4. Come to office hours: Tu 11:15-12:15p, Th 9-10a (Aerospace Cafe)

## Core Idea to Remember {.smaller}

::: {style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2em;"}

**Git is a time machine for your research.**

Every **commit** is a checkpoint.

Every **push** is a backup.

Every **pull** is synchronization.

You cannot break anything that cannot be fixed by cloning again.

:::

## Status. Add. Commit. Push. {.smaller}

::: {style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2em;"}

**That's it (for today).**

```bash
git status
git add <file>
git commit -m "What I did"
git push
```

You now know enough to Git crazy.

Everything else is a bonus.

# Lab: Put Your Lorenz Project on GitHub {background-color="#9CA898"}

## Lab Assignment: Your First Real Repo {.smaller .scrollable}

**This week's lab:** Put your `lorenz_project/` from Week 5.5 under version control on GitHub.

::: {.incremental}
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and click **New repository** (green button, top right)
2. Name it `lorenz-project`
3. Leave it **Public**, do **NOT** add a README or `.gitignore` (we'll add our own)
4. Click **Create repository**
5. GitHub will show you a URL — copy it
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Then in your terminal:**

```bash
# Clone the empty repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lorenz-project.git

# Copy your Week 5.5 files into it
cp -r ~/ATOC4815/lorenz_project/*.py lorenz-project/

# Move into the repo
cd lorenz-project
```
:::

## Lab: Add, Commit, Push Your Code {.smaller .scrollable}

**Now use the workflow you just learned — one commit per file:**

```bash
git status                              # See all your untracked files

git add integrators.py
git commit -m "Add Euler integration functions"

git add lorenz63.py
git commit -m "Add Lorenz63 class with run and run_ensemble"

git add plotting.py
git commit -m "Add plotting utilities for attractor and ensemble"

git add run_lorenz_ensemble.py
git commit -m "Add driver script for 3-panel ensemble figure"

git push                                # Upload everything to GitHub
```

::: {.fragment}
**Verify on GitHub:** go to `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lorenz-project` — you should see your 4 files and 4 separate commits, each with a clear message.
:::

## Lab: Add Your Figure {.smaller}

**If you have your ensemble figure from Week 5.5, add that too:**

```bash
cp ~/ATOC4815/lorenz_project/lorenz_ensemble_predictability.png .
git add lorenz_ensemble_predictability.png
git commit -m "Add 3-panel ensemble predictability figure"
git push
```

::: {.fragment}
**Check `git log --oneline`:**

```
e5f6a7b Add 3-panel ensemble predictability figure
d4c3b2a Add driver script for 3-panel ensemble figure
c3b2a1f Add plotting utilities for attractor and ensemble
b2a1f0e Add Lorenz63 class with run and run_ensemble
a1f0e9d Add Euler integration functions
```

Five clean commits. Your Lorenz project now has a full history on GitHub.
:::

## Lab Deliverables {.smaller}

**Submit on Canvas:**

::: {.incremental}
1. The URL to your GitHub repo: `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lorenz-project`
2. A screenshot of your commit history on GitHub (click "commits" on the repo page)

**Grading:**

| Item | Points |
|------|--------|
| Repo created and accessible on GitHub | 20% |
| All 4 `.py` files committed separately (not one giant commit) | 40% |
| Clear, descriptive commit messages (start with a verb) | 20% |
| Figure committed and visible in repo | 10% |
| `git log --oneline` screenshot shows clean history | 10% |

::: {.fragment}
**This repo is yours for the rest of the semester.** Next week we'll add a `.gitignore`, create branches, and learn to collaborate. Everything you build from here goes into this repo.
