## For Prospective Students

If you're interested in joining our group as a graduate student, please email me directly.

We are particularly interested in students with backgrounds in:

- Machine learning and data science
- Applied mathematics or physics
- Programming (Python, Fortran, or similar)

Familiarity with climate models, numerical methods, or high-performance computing is a plus but not required.
