## Current Courses

### Spring 2026: ATOC 4815/5815 - Scientific Programming, Data Analysis and Visualization Laboratory

This course teaches Python programming alongside data analysis skills for atmospheric and oceanic sciences. Students learn to access, analyze, and visualize scientific datasets through hands-on code development. The curriculum covers curve fitting, re-gridding/aggregation of satellite observations and meteorological data for global climatologies, culminating in an independent final project.

**Course Level**: Undergraduate (4815) / Graduate (5815)

**Prerequisites**: Prior Python experience or basic programming course (CSCI 1300 equivalent), plus calculus and algebra

Course materials and announcements will be posted on Canvas. For questions about enrollment or course content, please email wchapman@colorado.edu.

## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in hands-on, project-based learning that bridges theoretical understanding with practical applications. My courses emphasize:

- **Reproducible research practices**: Version control, documentation, and open science
- **Collaborative problem-solving**: Group projects and peer review
- **Real-world applications**: Working with actual climate model output and observational datasets
- **Computational literacy**: High-performance computing, data management, and visualization
