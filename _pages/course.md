## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in hands-on, project-based learning that bridges theoretical understanding with practical applications. My courses emphasize:

- **Reproducible research practices**: Version control, documentation, and open science
- **Collaborative problem-solving**: Group projects and peer review
- **Real-world applications**: Working with actual climate model output and observational datasets
- **Computational literacy**: High-performance computing, data management, and visualization
