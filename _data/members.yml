  bio: |
    My research focuses on weather and climate predictability, with a particular emphasis on extreme weather events, machine learning applications in atmospheric science, and hybrid dynamical-statistical modeling approaches.

    Previously, I was an Project Scientist and ASP Post-Doctoral Fellow at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and a lead-scientist for the Multiscale Machine Learning In Coupled Earth System Modeling (M2Lines) project. I earned my doctorate in Oceanography from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, where I investigated predictability of North American West Coast weather patterns using Deep Learning and explored coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomena.
